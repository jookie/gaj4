# GoLive Radio - live broadcasting

## Introduction

GoLiveTV is a live streaming platform that allows people around the world to stream their own shows. A platform makes it easy for anyone to live broadcast their information at a moment's notice. 

Anybody can listen to live and archived broadcasts. In order to create a broadcast, one must log in or sign up and create a station. Once you've created a station you can then create a broadcast and go live! After you've finished broadcasting, broadcasts are automatically archived. Your previous broadcasts can be found on your station page or on the all broadcasts page. 

GoLiveTV will be undergoing continuous development, so feel check in now and then to see what new developments we've rolled out.

## How Artificial Intelligence is Regulating Live Video Streams

AI and Machine learning is one of the most common uses of Artificial Intelligence solutions today. It involves training an algorithm with large sets of data and applied to new data. For example, machine learning algorithms are used for tasks like image recognition, facial recognition etc.

## Artificial intelligence (AI) to make my live streaming more effective?

With AI, content discovery becomes easier – If you are using social media sites like Twitter and Facebook for promotion, artificial intelligence can help you find the best time to broadcast your content so that more users will be able to see it

## Conclusion

Content Indexing to Improve User Experience- ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has found a way to integrate AI with human creation to enhance video content, thus providing an even better experience for its users. TikTok, which lets users create short videos that can be shared with friends or posted on other social media platforms, is popular among young people. To keep up with the demand for new videos, GoLiveTV has developed a system that leverages AI to learn from user preferences and provide them with relevant content suggestions.

## Artificial Intelligence-Based Security Systems:

The security system based on artificial intelligence relies on our machine learning models which can detect unknown attacks. They don’t depend upon blacklisting as they are based on patterns.


## The Technology Used

GoLiveTV uses a library built off of WebRTC and utilizing Socket.io called RTCMulticonnection. Socket.io is used to form a peer-to-peer connection taking the broadcasting burden off of the server. Each broadcast is capable of hosting up to 1000 connections. 

## Future goals for this project:
  - call-in system
  - broadcaster/caller rating system
  - station/broadcast rating system
  - soundboard
  - station, broadcast and user profile editing
  - scheduling
  - custom image uploads for broadcasts and stations
  - station subscriptions
